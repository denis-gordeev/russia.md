# CBR Skill

Use this skill for official central-bank reference data in finance workflows.

## Use This Skill For

- Official FX reference rates
- Finance reporting annotations
- Bank or payment metadata derived from CBR materials
- Back-office workflows that require official publication timestamps

## Workflow

1. Pull the latest available official CBR data.
2. Record publication date and retrieval time.
3. Distinguish reference values from executable prices.
4. Attach source metadata to any downstream calculation or report.

## Output Contract

```json
{
  "dataset": "fx|directory|reference",
  "published_at": "",
  "retrieved_at": "",
  "values": {},
  "advice_disclaimer": true
}
```

## Guardrails

- Never present CBR reference data as personalized financial advice.
- Always stamp the time basis of the data.
- Be explicit when a workflow still needs commercial or broker data.
