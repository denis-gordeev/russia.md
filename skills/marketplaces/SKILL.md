# Marketplaces Skill

Use this skill for seller-side marketplace operations across the main Russian platforms.

## Use This Skill For

- Catalog and listing operations
- Inventory and stockout monitoring
- Seller reporting and conversion analysis
- Order exception triage
- Repricing support inside policy boundaries

## Workflow

1. Identify the platform: Ozon, Wildberries, Yandex Market, or multi-channel.
2. Classify the task as `catalog`, `stock`, `pricing`, `orders`, `ads`, or `reporting`.
3. Prefer analysis and draft changes before live mutations.
4. Record platform-specific validation limits before any content or price update.
5. Log every listing mutation with before/after snapshots.

## Output Contract

```json
{
  "platform": "ozon|wildberries|yandex-market|multi",
  "surface": "catalog|stock|pricing|orders|ads|reporting",
  "suggested_actions": [],
  "requires_human_approval": true,
  "change_log_required": true
}
```

## Guardrails

- Do not auto-change prices without explicit policy bounds.
- Keep marketplace-specific constraints visible in the result.
- Prefer draft content improvements over silent live edits.
- Preserve snapshots of listing state before every mutation.

## Typical Targets

- Ozon seller APIs
- Wildberries seller APIs
- Yandex Market seller APIs

## Bundled Resources

- See `references/integration-notes.md` for mutation logging and policy boundaries.

- See `schemas/output.schema.json` for the output contract schema.
